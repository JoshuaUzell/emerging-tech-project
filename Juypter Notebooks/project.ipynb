    "In the world of quantum computing, there are many different types of problems. One of these is called the parity problem. Whilst on the lower end of difficulty for problems in quantum computing, it's still an interesting enough challenge that evolves around the output of bits, and to see whether we get a constant output or a random balanced output from a function. We can solve this issue using the power of Deutsch's Algorithm. "

    "We'll first give a brief overview of quantum computing so we can understand why it's relevant. Then we'll compare quantum computing against classical and then we'll talk about the Deutsch Algorithm, going over the problem it's trying to solve, the solution it provides and then we'll implement that solution using Qiskit by creating a quantum circuit. Lastly we'll run the circuit and see the results before summurizing with our conclusion. Note that the code was created with the aid of Open A.I's ChatGPT with comments and explainations written by myself."

    "According to IBM **[1]**, classical computation (everyday computation on computers) is becoming trickier to use for solving specific complex problems due to using old transistors. Supercomputers have been used to try and solve these issues but even then, we will still reach a limit when it comes to very complex issues due to the many different things that can interact with eachother.**[1]** (https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing)\n",

    "This algorithm is important because of its ability to solve the Deutsch Problem. This problem was based on the idea of a 'black-box' which was a function that took in a single input and could have an output of either 0 or 1. **[2]** The issue with this (as stated by the name) was how unclear it was in terms of which output would be returned.

    "This was because the function would either be constant in that it returned the same bit (1 or 0) each time no matter the input or balanced in that if you were to put in 0 as an input, you would get 1 as an output and vice versa. The challenge here is that you can only use this function once in order to check whether it is constant or balanced. **[2]** "
