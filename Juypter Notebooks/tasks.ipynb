    "According to **Daniel John Thompson** from the **Royal Australian Chemical Institue**, the **Collatz Conjecture** is a mathematics problem set forth by mathematician **Lothar Collatz** in 1937. It proposes that if you take any whole positive number of type 'n', you can always reduce it down to the number one. This is done via 2 linear equations that either multiply 'n' by 3 and add on 1 if 'n' is odd, or simply divide 'n' by 2 if it's even.**[1] (https://www.ripublication.com/atam22/atamv17n1_01.pdf)** "
