# Emerging-tech-project
By Joshua Uzell

# Purpose of repo
The purpose of this repo is showcase my work for the Emerging Technologies Module in my Computer Science Course at ATU. The repo contains 2 jupyter notebooks. One notebook goes over Deutsch's Algorithm and the other is about tasks that I completed that are related to quantum computing.

# project.ipynb
This notebook goes over the topic of Deutsch's Algorithm, talking about the problem that it solves and how it goes about solving it.

# tasks.ipynb
This notebook goes over tasks that needed to be completed for the module. The notebook goes over solving certain problems like the collatz conjecture, calculating a square root of a number, the mapping of inputs to outputs and multiplying matrices.
