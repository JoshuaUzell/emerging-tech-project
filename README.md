# Emerging-tech-project
By Joshua Uzell

# Purpose of repo
The purpose of this repo is to showcase my work for the Emerging Technologies Module in my Computer Science Course at ATU. The repo has a folder called "Jupyter Notebooks" which is where all my work for the repo is done. This folder contains 2 jupyter notebooks. One notebook goes over Deutsch's Algorithm and the other is about four tasks that I have completed for the emerging tech module.

# project.ipynb
This notebook goes over the topic of Deutsch's Algorithm, talking about the problem that it solves and how it goes about solving it.

# tasks.ipynb
This notebook goes over tasks that needed to be completed for the module. The notebook goes over solving certain problems like the collatz conjecture, calculating a square root of a number, the mapping of inputs to outputs and multiplying matrices.
